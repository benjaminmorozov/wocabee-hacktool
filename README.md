if you want to remake it just divide the app into two parts, the grabber and the filler
the grabber:
 - gives you a blank workspace
 - you fill out the first exercise
 - selenium reads all the vocab used and saves it to a local db
the filler:
 - selenium uses the local db to fill out the remaining exercises
 - farms infinitely
 - just dont be dumb and get like 100k points, thats just plain stupid
